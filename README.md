## About Me
Hi, My name is Quincy Bell, as a lefty I often find myself using the creative side of my brain. Though, most wouldn't consider me incredibly artsy or poetic. Im detailed oriented and I love finding creative ways to solve problems. I've worked in different industries over my 40 some odd years but over the last decade I worked in manufacturing enviroments. I always found myself in positions where I was the technical go to, or the general problem solver. I noticed that I was always able to spot a problem quickly as well as spotting what could potentially become a problem.I was an advocate for making sure the processes were easy, and issues that didnt have to happen.....didnt. I decided to trade in my steel toes and exploit my talent in the tech space. I had plenty of practice before hand, as my wife is a UX researcher and would always request a pair of eyes on different apps and websites. I took it a step further and enrolled in a QA bootcamp. Career transitions are scary, but I was up for the challenge. I've been working on a project for about a year, and I have really enjoyed it. I'm excited to see what other software I can impact in the world of QA.
